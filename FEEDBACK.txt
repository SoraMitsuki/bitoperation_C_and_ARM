Great commenting! AMAZING test cases!

Things that you might want to consider revolve around multiline commenting.
For example, line 245 you have "/* use OR to change all the 1's in the number */"
It's not a big issue, but sometimes the extra stars can be confusing. It can be a single line comment instead.

Also, on line 271-272, you don't need the stars on every line if it's multiline.
"
 /* find difference of x with max and min and then shift it to n +1 */
 /* to the left and opposite it */
"

Can be:
/* find difference of x with max and min and then shift it to n +1
   to the left and opposite it */
